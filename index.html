					<h3>The Problem</h3>
					<p>The FIFA World Cup is one of the largest sporting events in the world. Understanding what drives
					teams to succeed is important not only for coaches and players in this massive tournament, but also
					for the fans who lack national representation and are searching for a teach to follow and support.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-3">
					<h3>Collection & Cleaning</h3>
					<p>We collected data from multiple sources in order to build a more comprehensive and well-tuned model.
					These data sources included <a href="http://www.eloratings.net/">ELO Adjusted Ranking Data</a> and
					<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup">data from every World Cup tournament and regional qualifying tournament</a> from 1950 the present.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-3">
					<h3>Exploration</h3>
					<p>We began our exploratory data analysis in R, making use of the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyr and ggplot2</a> packages to reformat and 
					visualize the data, respectively. We then turned to D3 and Tableau to present the key findings from our EDA on the web.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-3">
					<h3>Prediction</h3>
					<p>Finally, we followed the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html">recommendation of the Scikit-Learn library in Python</a> 
						to select, train, and tune two multi-class classification machine learning model to predict performance in the FIFA World Cup given past 
					experience in the tournament and athletic performance indicators from the qualifying tournament of that year.</p>

				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p>We synthesized multiple sources of data in order to better characterize the skills of the teams participating in the FIFA World Cup from 1950 to the present. This time period was selected due to the consistently evolving nature of the tournament, which resulted in the tournaments prior to 1950 taking on a largely different format as the tournament audiences are familiar with today. In particular, we collected data from 
					<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.eloratings.net/">eloratings.net</a> which archives historical performance metrics of regional and international teams from 1910 to the present.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup">Kaggle’s data dump for FIFA World Cup statistics</a>, in which users offer up sources of data which are subsequently evaluated and cleaned by Kaggle staff.</li>
					</ul>
					For transparency and objectivity in our analysis, we summarize our work with the data and assess its potential flaws below.</p>
					<h3>Completeness</h3>
					<p>We found that these data sources were incredibly accurate in identifying the results of each FIFA World Cup game and appearance for each team involved. Fortunately, the World Cup is a major sporting event in the international community which drives many individuals to be passionate about the statistics relating to the event. This helps to ensure the data is comprehensive, not lacking any key statistics or metrics, and quickly update these databases when changes occur. In our data cleaning and manipulation, we also made the choice to omit countries in our final web visualizations who lack any representation at the World Cup during this time period. While including these lesser known, not as successful on the international stage teams may have introduced an interesting exploratory element to our analysis, we opted to remove these observations from the data to improve the overall clarity of our work and analysis.</p>

					<h3>Coherence</h3>
					<p>Upon reviewing the data and analyzing it in R, we found the the data was largely coherent with itself. For instance, we found that the number of games played by any team in a given year does not exceed seven games, which exactly aligns with the maximum number of games played in the tournament from the Group Stage to the final match. This being said, when integrating the two data sets, we did notice that many countries were listed differently. For example, one of the datasets referred to the Democratic Republic of Congo as Zaire, which is historically correct but currently inaccurate. This led to some minor issues when joining the dataset; however, we circumvented this dilemma by manually recoding any factor levels that have changed to more current forms. Additionally, as previously mentioned, the format of the tournament continues to change slightly from year to year. While the World Cup remained largely consistent over the selected time period for our analysis, some minor recoding was required in order to ensure the levels of the tournament remained consistent from year to year.

					</p>

					<h3>Correctness</h3>
					<p>Due to the pseudo-crowdsourcing nature of the Kaggle dataset, we believe that this data is mostly correct. Similar to Wiikipedia, the Kaggle repository may be updated my members of the data science community, which might introduce some incorrect information to these files. However, since these “bad actors” are likely the minority, any incorrect changes to the data would likely either be changed by other members of the community or overridden by the staff at Kaggle whose responsibilities include the maintenance of the accuracy of these publically available data sources. Moreover, we can verify many of the data points in these data sets by simply searching the internet for game-by-game statistics. Finally, the ELO data we use in our model is derived through a formula, however the site author providing these statistics also includes his/her methodology for calculating these ratings.
					</p>

					<h3>Accountability</h3>
					<p>Despite the potential lapses in accountability associated with crowdsourcing information, Kaggle maintains a relatively comprehensive log on any changes done to the data and the subsequent edits actually accepted by the Kaggle staff. Therefore, the Kaggle data is accountable and the primary sources for this information are included in the body of their methodology. The ELO ratings data is less direct in citing the primary sources of its data although it might be assumed that it is pulling information from the similar game-by-game sources cited on Kaggle. For these reasons, we believe that this data is mostly accountable, but we hold some reservations regarding the original source of the information presented on ELO ratings.

								<p>While our raw data sources provided some of these key variables, we used feature engineering to derive some potentially more meaningful predictors in our analysis. For instance, the average goals scored per game was actually derived through a simple division of the total number of goals a team scored in a given year by the total number of games that team played. Additionally, we derived a series of six rolling sums for each team to track how many appearances that team had made at each particular stage of the tournament (Group Stage, Field of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals, Champion). These variables were motivated by our belief that teams who do best in the tournament this year might also be the teams that historically performed well on this international stage.</p>

								<p>We found three interesting correlations between relevant variables. First, teams that play more games tend to lose games more frequently, apart from a few outliers such as Croatia, and Ukraine, and Slovenia. Interestingly, these teams that play more games in a given year also see a fewer share of their games result in a tie match, or a draw. The data also logically shows a negative correlation between the ELO rating and the World rank, which means that teams that play more challenging opponents and win are given a higher ELO rating and their rank on the world stage improves, with a rank of 1 representing the best team in the world in that given year. Finally, there is only a slightly negative relationship between win ratio and world rank, which suggests that rank takes into account other variables besides win ratio. We invite the user to explore these relationships and other potentially interesting correlations between key variables in our model using the customizable scatter-plot that accompanies this analysis.

								<p>There are different extensions of this study that might be interesting but that out of the scope of this particular exercise. For example, it might be interesting to measure if there is home-field advantage for World Cup hosts countries. In general, people believe that host countries have an advantage over other teams given that part of the tournament’s revenue is generated by ticket sales and that turnout for the home team often dwarfs the attendance of other nations. Additionally, future analysis might incorporate other facets the structure of the tournament and performance metrics such as penalty card records, offensive/defensive strategies across teams, and the monetary value of each time as measured by each individual player’s salary when they play on the non-national team (ex. FC Barcelona, Manchester United, etc.). While these metrics may have improved the predictive power of our machine learning algorithms, the data quality concerns presented in cleaning these sources proved intractable given the scope of this analysis.

					<p style="color: white">As previously discussed, we created a set of features for our analysis to take each team’s historic performance in the FIFA World Cup into account when making predictions regarding future World Cup performance. Therefore, in practice, all teams started at the same level in 1950 with each rolling sum which corresponds to each stage in the World Cup tournament being initialized to zero. Very quickly, however, historically high performing teams began surging ahead as they accumulated World Cup appearances and wins on this international-level. Therefore, as we move forward in time, we expect teams who experienced long-term success since the 1950s such as Argentina, Brazil, and France, to gradually see these rolling features increase while teams that were more recently introduced to the World Cup, such as Senegal and Panama, see these metrics remain relatively constant at low levels since 1950.</p>
<p style="color: white">To illustrate the intuition in these features, we designed the included heatmap. Each cell of this 32 by 6 grid represents the number of times that each team that qualified for the 2018 World Cup reached each stage of the World Cup in the past. Additionally, we included a temporal aspect of this visualization and invite users to explore how the current qualifiers for the 2018 group stage grew into the successful teams they are today by selecting which year of data to use in the visualization: 1978, 1998, or 2018. We see that many of these teams were not on the World Stage in 1978, with Argentina and Brazil being the two notable exceptions. However, as we look at more current data in 1998 and even more so in 2018, we see the emergence of the current teams and the growth of a more competitive field in the tournament. </p>

								<p>This section is to compare team’s performance during past tournaments clustered by groups. For context, this type of grouped comparison is relevant because the first stage of the tournament is a round-robin competition, in which every team within a group of four plays against each other. Then, only the winner and the runner-up advance to the next step, the sixteen teams round. In this bar chart, we compare teams by multiple performance metrics including average rank, the total number of goals, and game results. You can also filter by different variables. Unsurprisingly, we quickly notice that the usual favorite teams: Brazil, Argentina, Germany, and England, stand significantly above the other teams in their Group on most metrics of performance. Despite their past success in the qualification round, it is not guaranteed that these teams will pass to the next round given each Groups’ composition. Based on the statistics, some groups are more balanced regarding team performance than others. For example, Egypt is ranked comparatively low on the world stage at 77, yet may have a decent chance at making it into the Field of 16 given the other teams in its group. However, Sweden, which is ranked higher at 16, could be eliminated in the Group Stage by either Mexico or Germany.</p>
